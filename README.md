# QR-code-Generator
A simple Node.js CLI application that generates a QR code from a user-provided URL. It uses the inquirer package to collect input, qr-image to create the QR code, and fs to save both the QR image and the original URL into files. This is a beginner-friendly utility demonstrating command-line interactivity and file system operations in Node.js.
